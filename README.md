froschServer
---

#### 1. What is froschServer?
froschServer is a little project of mine where I try to create a Backend/Frontend framework for a message-board. 
It's mostly a passion project as most of the project I do at work don't allow for the creative freedom that I usually
enjoy having.

#### 2. What inspired froschServer?
I am a professional Django developer. The problem with Django is that it rarely challenges its user. Everything is 
predefined and leaves little to no room for creative freedom. In a professional setting surely the obvious and right 
choice to make. 

#### 3. Why Java?
I love Java. My first encounter with the language in university was far from perfect. But after passage of time I came 
to enjoy the coding philosophy and syntax that Java has. The code just looks and feels sexy. Especially after coding
40h/week in a whitespace-heavy language with no type-annotations like Python a language like Java really feels like a 
blessing. Everything is predefined, everything has a structure. 

#### 4. What's the end goal?
There is none. I enjoy coding in Java. I know that I'll never be able to replicate even 1% of the functions that Django
has, so I don't really have an end goal set. I have multiple smaller milestones, e.g. message network, then users, then
HTML renderer. Furthermore, I think that having a finish line on a project THIS BIG is counterproductive as it just
overwhelms one single developer. If my end goal is to replicate most of the functions Django has in one way or the other
I'll surely never be motivated as it's frankly impossible for one, average developer to achieve.
